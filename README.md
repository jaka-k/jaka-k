### Hey, Iâ€™m Jaka ðŸ‘‹

As a software engineer, I love building clean, explicit systems. My toolbox includes **Go**, **TypeScript**, a solid grounding in **Python**, and event-driven microservicesâ€”but my curiosity often pulls me beyond familiar ground. The best days are spent diving deep, uncovering how large-scale architectures really work, and exploring why certain patterns emerge when theory meets the real world.

My path into tech wasn't through traditional CSâ€”I studied political science first. But somewhere along the way, I realized I wanted to build thingsâ€”real things that work. Six years ago, JavaScript became my gateway: first vanilla React, then Next.js, and Iâ€™ve never really looked back. Today, this unconventional background helps me bridge gaps between developers, designers, and stakeholders, making sure we build something valuable, not just technically perfect.

Professionally, my experience spans from leading frontend rewrites in React and Next.js, to building backend services that scale reliably in Go. On weekends, you'll often find me tackling ambitious side projectsâ€”like my [Multiagent RAG Chat](https://github.com/jaka-k/multiagent-rag-system), an LLM-powered learning app integrated directly with my Anki decks. I believe in rigorous yet pragmatic code, explicit interfaces, typed everything, and well-managed complexity.

What sets me apart:
- **A genuine enthusiasm for understanding systems**, not just frameworks.
- **An ability to focus deeply**, turning complexity into clarity.
- **A healthy skepticism of dogma and tribalism** (yes, even in the JS and Go ecosystems).
- **Enough weekend hacking to rival years of internships**.

Outside coding, youâ€™ll find me lifting weights at the gym, hiking mountains, playing basketball, or traveling Europe to visit friendsâ€”usually with dark techno beats keeping me company.

There's also a wild variety of other interests and plenty of cool anecdotesâ€”like the deer trophy hanging in my hallway. Maybe Iâ€™ll tell you about it sometime.

Letâ€™s connect, build something interesting, or just nerd out about tech.
